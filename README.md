# Face-Mask-Detection-OpenCV-SVC-SGD-KNN
Surgical Masks play crucial role in protecting us as well as people around us. It helps decrease the intensity of respiratory diseases like COVID-19 while the immunization for it, is unavailable. Though, it is not compulsory to wear the mask publicly, but according to the guidance from World Health Organization (WHO), it is advisable to wear the mask which might prevent the spread of any airborne transmission to some extent. This project aims to develop an algorithm to detect if an individual is wearing a mask or not and then the system will trigger an alert if the person is not wearing or incorrectly wearing it. The project will talk about the approach and implementation of algorithms and the scope of it to some extent.
